        <h1>Getting to Know Lilly</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am a Sophomore at Ozarks Technical Community College in the Associate of Computer Science degree program.
        Some classes that I have taken include Website Development 1, Python, C# 1, and Introduction to Technology.
      In addition to my computer classes, I am also proficient in Algebra, Trigonometry,
     and Calculus 1. Some classes I will be taking are Database and Query, Website Development 2,
      and C# 2. I will be graduating Spring 2023.</p>

        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>I am looking for freelance website development jobs where I can help my clients
         through the development process from start to finish. I enjoy making websites using wireframes and
        then coding the website just the way the client is looking for. Some prior work experience that
      I have in website development is working with my classmates as my clients to make a <a href="projects.html">National Park website</a>.
     I have also taken feedback from others on my personal website projects to make them more appealing and user-friendly.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>On my own time, I love to do a variety of things! Currently, I'm focusing on expanding my computer skillset.
         I'm working on a few 3D modeling projects. I've already completed a realistic chair, and now I'm modeling a
        bedroom with a bed, rug, lamp, other accessories, and an animated sleeping cat.
      I also enjoy making video games. I'm starting development on my first 3D game with 2D
     sprites. It should hopefully be done by the end of the summer. Finally, I enjoy baking and decorating cakes, drawing, and sculpting
    with clay.</p>
