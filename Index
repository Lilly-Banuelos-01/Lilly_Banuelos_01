        <h2>Programmer</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, I am a programmer! Whether you need me to work With
         HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, or C#, I can do all the behind the scenes
        work for your website or application. I have more than a year of experience
       under my belt, and am always aquiring new technological skills. I love to code
      solutions to anything you can think of, whether you need something for personal
     use, business, or commercial applications. I work with you to make sure everything
    turns out exactly like you're expecting, and am flexible when it comes to
   adding elements to your project. I have worked on many projects throughout my
  budding career as a full-stack developer, making my code comprehensive and interactive.</p>

        <h2>Designer</h2>
        <p>I am a designer! Not only will I code websites and applications for you,
         but I also love to design them. My designs typically will follow themes
        found in your project, or otherwise are based on your personal preferences.
      My work features many images to showcase clients' different products or highlighted items,
     and are also doubled up as links to appropriate sections of the site where appropriate.
    I love adding interactive elements as well, as it adds a certain spark to projects
   and greatly increases website traffic. I can also use software to custom make images
  and logos as needed for your site or application, making changes as you request. I work through
 the design process with you start to finish.</p>

        <h2>Specialties</h2>
        <p><b>HTML and CSS</b>. I can do back-end development for your website.
        I work with flexboxes and resizing elements based on screen size, so that
      the website will look great on any device. I can encorporate any links or interactive
    elements as well.</p>
        <p><b>JavaScript</b>. If your website needs any user-interactive elements, I can
         add it anywhere you need it. I have experience with arrays, variables,
       and many different script tags. For examples, please see the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.</p>
        <p><b>Python and C#</b>. If you need anything outside of a website, either through
        a link or related project, I am experienced in these programming languages. With these languages, I can make games
       or interactive elements as you need.</p>
