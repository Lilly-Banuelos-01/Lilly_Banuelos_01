        <p>For this project, the specification was to make a list that displays
         one random card from each card suit. I did this using JavaScript to create this
        fun little game. My partner covered the second half
       where the player gets assigned a random number and has to guess it to win.
      To get new values for both, the page needs to be refreshed.</p>

        <p>This is a screenshot from a website I made for a company called Roots Garden
         Center. Here you can see the about page where the company's founder and leaders
        are highlighted. It covers some of their accomplishments and helps visitors to the site
      understand what Roots is all about.</p>

        <p>This project was for a food truck. The owners wanted to
         include the times and places where the truck would be visiting each week.
        They also asked to include the different events they stop at throughout the year.
       I showcase this through a table under the events page. This is a screenshot of the
      welcome page.</p>

        <img src="war.jpg" alt="Project 4">

        <p>This is a website version of the classic card game war. To play, the players
         hit play and a card is chosen for each from any of four suits. The player
        with the highest card value wins. If the cards are the same in value, there is a tie.
       At the end of the round, the players are asked if they want to play agian.</p>

        <img src="yogi.jpg" alt="Project 5">

        <p>This is a website I made for YogiBear State Park. The park rangers really
         wanted to get more people involved in their activities and nature reserve program.
        To do this, I used a gallery and plenty of images to showcase the beauty and amenities of the
       park. This is from the home page.</p>

        <p>Hawaii has many activities and opportunities for tourists. A company
         specializing in recreational activities reached out to me to design their home page.
        I focused on using a beach-toned color scheme and images to draw visitors in. Their top
        attractions are included on the front page as well.</p>
